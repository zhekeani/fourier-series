**Fourier Series Visualization in the Complex Plane**, where you can observe how a Fourier series creates complex shapes by summing rotations with different frequencies. Adjust parameters such as the number of iterations and frequency to see how each term contributes to the formation of intricate curves in real-time. This interactive tool demonstrates the power of Fourier series to represent any shape through the combination of rotating vectors.

**Note:** Ensure that your device and browser support WebGL2.
